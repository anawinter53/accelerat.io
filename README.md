# ACCELERAT.IO

Welcome to accelerat.io, my first project aiming to fill in the knowledge gap for tech bootcamps in UK. This project will be completed alongside classes at La Fosse Academy.


## WHY?

When I made the career switch to tech, deciding on which bootcamp to apply for was one of the most difficult parts. This program aims to use real reviews to allow individuals to make more informed decisions.
